## Abstract

>  Recent work on the Internet, social networks, and the power grid has addressed the resilience of
these networks to either random or targeted deletion of network nodes or links. Such deletions include,
for example, the failure of Internet routers or power transmission lines. Percolation models on random
graphs provide a simple representation of this process but have typically been limited to graphs with
Poisson degree distribution at their vertices. Such graphs are quite unlike real-world networks, which
often possess power-law or other highly skewed degree distributions. In this paper we study percolation
on graphs with completely general degree distribution, giving exact solutions for a variety of cases,
including site percolation, bond percolation, and models in which occupation probabilities depend on
vertex degree. We discuss the application of our theory to the understanding of network resilience.
