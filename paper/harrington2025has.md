## Abstract

> When women become mothers, they often take a step back from their careers. Could work from 
home (WFH) reduce this motherhood penalty, particularly in traditionally family-unfriendly 
careers? We leverage technological changes prior to the pandemic that increased the feasibility of 
WFH in some college degrees but not others. In degrees where WFH increased, motherhood gaps 
in employment narrowed: for every 10% increase in WFH, mothers’ employment rates increased 
by 0.78 per centage points (or 0.94%) relative to other women’s. This change is driven by majors 
linked to careers that have high returns to hours and inflexible demands on workers’ time. We 
microfound these results using panel data that show that women who could WFH before childbirth 
are less likely to exit the workforce.
